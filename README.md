### What is this app about?
This is a simple app that lets you create an account and add tasks. You can create, view, update and remove tasks.
I used Django webframework along with html, css and javascript. 
I created this app to learn about basic CRUD with Django.
### Is it missing something?
Yes, ajax and a lot of stuff. (sadly)
